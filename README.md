# Most of the time, arrays will hold all of the same type

# Queues and Stacks

 - Queue: One-dimensional list (line) First in, first out (FIFO)

 - Stack: Pancakes - Last in, first out (LIFO)
 
 - Arrays are more flexible than a stack, stack is just a way to access an array in a particular order

 - "The Call Stack" - Chain of functions, the last one that was called is the first one to finish.
